No personal information has been collected as part of this study’s data collection process and web scraping best practices implemented to the best of the author’s abilities. The collected data will be inaccessible to the public to abide by Section 7 of the Terms and Conditions agreement laid out by Tesco PLC.\nSince July 2021 the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate in the UK has broken away from the Bank of England’s target rate of 2%, steadily rising month by month. As of 3rd September 2022, the inflation rate stands at 10.1% with no indication of decreasing. What an awfully depressing way to start a blog post but unfortunately this is the reality that we are all currently facing in the UK. Every month the Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculates CPI by collecting the prices for a basket of around 730 different consumer goods and services that is a representation of the society’s current buying habits and measures the average change in price of the basket on a year-over-year basis. At a risk of grossly simplifying, CPI tells us how much prices in general have changed over the last 12 months.\nThat’s all nice and well but society’s buying habits doesn’t necessarily reflect my buying habits. There are 12 broad categories of goods and services in the CPI basket, some of these categories such as clothing and footwear, and furniture and household goods don’t apply to me as I rarely ever buy new clothes or furniture. The full list of categories and goods and services of each category can be found on the ONS website here. One category that does apply to me, and to everyone else, is food and drinks. Food and drink goods (excluding alcohol) currently account for 9.3% of the weighting in CPI, which is a relatively small slice of the pie.\nDuring recent times I’ve noticed that my shopping bill has gone up overall but I can’t quite pin down what items are contributing the most to this increase. To this end, I’ve built a cloud-based web-scraping application that scrapes product data from Tesco’s website including price and categories (GitHub link - blog article incoming). The reason why I chose Tesco as opposed to any other supermarket is because it’s 5 minutes down the road from me.\nIn this article we’ll load, process, transform, and analyse this scraped data to see how the prices of food categories have changed over time.

    "section": "Overview of Price Changes for All Categories",
    "text": "Overview of Price Changes for All Categories\nLet’s start with the big picture (quite literally), how did prices change when comparing the basket values of categories?\nNote that the index numbers presented in the graph below are accurate when rounding to whole numbers.\nTechnical explanation - The numbers get more inaccurate as you go up category granularities due to the way that the index numbers are aggregated. I’m using the most granular dataset that contains index numbers of quaternary categories, these are then aggregated up to the tertiary category level using the harmonic mean weighted by the basket value of the quaternary categories within the tertiary category. This process repeats for the secondary and then the primary categories, the approximation error increasing going up with each category level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart is interactive!\n\n\n\nHover your mouse over the sector to look at the index number of categories (if on mobile, tap and hold the name of the category). Clicking on a sector will focus on that particular category and its subcategories. There are 4 levels of categories but only 3 levels are shown at any one time for better performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nStraight away we can see that fresh food and frozen food have increased by ~3% and ~4% respectively. The major contributing subcategories for fresh food are cheese (~5% increase); fresh meat and poultry (~5% increase); ready meals (~4% increase); and yogurts (~4% increase). For frozen food, the major contributing subcategories are frozen fish and seafood (~9% increase); frozen chips, onion rings, potatoes, and rice (~12% increase); and frozen meat and poultry (~5% increase).\nYikes, no wonder why my shopping bill has been going up. Fresh chicken breast and thighs have gone up by over 10%!\nOverall, prices have by 1.7% across all categories and products in the processed dataset.\nWe can also see there are a few secondary categories that have gone down, most notably is the cooking sauces, meal kits, and sides subcategory within the food cupboard category which has gone down by ~2%. This does raise another question though, how many categories in each level experienced an increase, decrease, or no change in price?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s very clear from the above that the bakery and frozen food primary categories had all secondary, tertiary, and quaternary subcategories either increase in price or stay the same! We’ll have to note that they’re the two smallest primary categories by both total basket value and number of subcategories, but there are ongoing macroeconomic events that are affecting both the supply chain and cost of businesses.\nAs of writing, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine is affecting the two largest global suppliers of wheat. Russia produces 11% of the world’s wheat and accounts for 19% of global wheat exports. On the other hand, Ukraine produces 3% of the world’s wheat and accounts for 9% of global wheat exports. Both of these together account for more than a quarter of the world’s wheat export market.1 You can guess what ingredient bakery goods use that’s derived from wheat.1 Source: https://asmith.ucdavis.edu/news/russia-ukraine\nEnergy prices have also been rising throughout 2022 and are forecasted to reach unprecedented levels during the first two quarters of 2023. The electricity price (kWh) cap rose from 20.8p in Q1 2022 to 28.3p in Q2 2022,2 an increase of 36%. This will affect the production costs of all goods, more so if they need to be kept cold or frozen.2 Source: https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2022/sept-2022/chart-of-the-week-energy-price-cap-update\nGenerally speaking, it does seem that the vast majority of subcategories have experienced an increase in price, no matter what level of category granularity is being looked at. The drinks and food cupboard primary categories are the least affected as they’re the only two that contain secondary categories that have decreased in price; that being said they only account for 11.1% and 18.8% of the total number of their respective total secondary categories."

    "text": "Price Changes for Primary Food Categories\nLet’s now take a look at how the index of primary categories changed over time as opposed to a snapshot in time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things I’m seeing from this graph. First is that bakery, drinks, and food cupboard items seem to be plateauing where as fresh and frozen items don’t seem to be slowing down. Second, the fresh and frozen items have the highest rate of increase amongst all primary categories. Third, the food cupboard and drinks categories seem to increase at the same rate were it not for the initial hike on 6th March. Finally, the bakery category is the only one that looks to practically stay the same for the first five weeks before rapidly increasing at the same rate as the fresh and frozen food categories and then plateauing.\nThe big question that comes to mind is what’s driving the price of fresh food items to go up? If we extrapolate out the trend for an entire year, we’re looking at an approximate increase of 12.5% for both categories! To answer this question we’ll have to dive into the secondary categories."

Both of these being products produced from animals.\nAccording to the Specialty Food Magazine, the price increase of dairy products can be largely attributed to the spiralling price of feed, fuel, and fertiliser.3 All of these three production costs have been subject to large price hikes. For feed and fertiliser, it can be attributed to the Russian invasion on Ukraine, higher energy costs, and increased global demand.4 For fuel, the primary driver is an increase in the refining cost of crude oil.53 Source: https://www.specialityfoodmagazine.com/news/dairy-crisis-threatens-spiralling-costs-of-cheese-and-milk-for-indies4 Source: https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/rising-cost-of-agricultural-fertiliser-and-feed-causes-impacts-and-government-policy/5 Source: https://www.allstarcard.co.uk/news-insights/business/why-is-fuel-expensive/\nIn Specialty Food Magazine’s article they have a quote from the vice-chair of the National Union of Farmers that it takes him two and a half years to get a cow from being born to be actually producing milk which incurs a lot of cost over the time period. In order to maintain their profit margins, they must raise their prices."
