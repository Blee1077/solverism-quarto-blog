<p>I’ve been a user of Spotify now since 2017 and during that time I’ve created a myriad of playlists, most of which I’m willing to admit I haven’t touched in a long time. Generally speaking, my playlists fall into one of four categories.</p>
<p>First, and most predominantly, is based on time. I create bimonthly playlists in which I add songs I’ve enjoyed throughout the two months, at the end of the year I’ll compile all 6 of those into a yearly round-up playlist. Second is based on music genre, I have playlists for each genre I listen to (of course there’s bound to be a bit of overlap). Third is based on language, I listen to a mixture of English, Japanese, Korean, and Cantonese songs. Fourth, and finally, are playlists created from song radios or other Spotify-generated means.</p>
<p>One thing that you might not know about Spotify is that it has an API that can be used by developers to create Spotify apps. It’s called the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/">Spotify Web API</a> and it allows you to control audio playback, manage your Spotify library, get metadata of tracks, artists, and albums, and so much more. I’m utilising the <code>Spotipy</code> Python library to use it. For my purposes I’ll be using it to get my playlists’ metadata and the audio features of tracks.</p>
<p>In this blog we’ll be going on a journey that explores my playlists in a data-driven way and eventually produce a machine learning algorithm that gives the most similar tracks in my playlists when provided with a track.</p>
<section id="data-overview" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Data Overview</h1>
<p>I’ve already done the hard work of collecting the data for each track within my playlists as well as sourcing external data used to determine the genre(s) of tracks. I’ve shown below a small extract of the data to get an idea of what we’re working with here:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-dictionary">Data Dictionary</h2>
<p>You might be looking at some of those column names with no idea what they mean or represent, luckily Spotify does provide explanations for their audio features. And even luckier for you, I’ve created a data dictionary that describes what each column represents. Note, the language column was created used my language playlists and the genre column was created using data from <a href="https://everynoise.com/">Every Noise at Once</a>.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>danceability</td>
<td>Mood</td>
<td>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>energy</td>
<td>Mood</td>
<td>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>loudness</td>
<td>Property</td>
<td>The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>speechiness</td>
<td>Property</td>
<td>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g.&nbsp;talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>acousticness</td>
<td>Context</td>
<td>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>instrumentalness</td>
<td>Property</td>
<td>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>liveness</td>
<td>Context</td>
<td>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>valence</td>
<td>Mood</td>
